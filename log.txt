This is my First Javascript/HTML/CSS program
Took me about 10 Hours, 5 Hours were trying to figure out how to get the buttons to return thier value and
be used in Javascript. Overall a good learning experience, main thing learned was how to use the elements in HTML
in javascript with the .getELement function and learned about Node Lists.(Still not enterly sure what they are)
There are a few problems(listed in index.js) and it looks like garabo but it was a decent learning experience.
